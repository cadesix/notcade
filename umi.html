<div id="titleText">Creative Direction - UMI</div>
<div id="subTitle">In the year since I started directing UMI’s videos, I’ve watched as she’s gone from recording songs in her dorm to touring across the country,
racking up millions of views and streams along the way.<br>

<p>I served as co-director on High School, UMI’s latest release, along with Eddie Mandell. We worked with UMI to take the video from conceptualization
to execution with a small budget of $5000. Along with our producer Nick Scully, we directed and managed 50 extras and a crew of over 10 people over a two day shoot.
I also served as director of photography, operating the camera for the duration of the shoot. In post I edited the majority of the video, as well as handled the color-grade.
Additional production design, sound design and marketing was provided by our small team at ourros.

<p>Friendzone, our first collaboration, was the first large-scale project that I had worked on. Along with a small team of USC students, 
  I conceptualized and co-directed this music video with absolutely no budget, no permits, and no idea what I was doing. I handled editing and color grading along with
  Eddie Mandell and Aamir Khuller, as well as animated parts of the video.</p>
