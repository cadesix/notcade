<div id="subTitle">In the role of creative director, I’ve worked with Michael over the past year to build his visual repertoire,
develop his voice as an artist, and create an aesthetic that's worthy of his dark, heavy-hitting music.<br>

<p>I co-directed the music video for Michael’s recent release, Black Lipstick,
alongside Nick Scully and Eddie Mandell. I shot all of the digital footage, color graded, and edited the video in full.
Our goal was to pay homage to 2000s skate videos while also building the
narrative in a way that channeled the same gritty, longing feelings Michael had when writing the song.

<p>I designed and developed <span class="webLink"><a href="http://1800casket4two.com">1800casket4two.com</a></span>, Michael’s website, as a platform for him to engage with fans, the public, and the industry.
Invoking the aesthetic of raw MySpace blogs of over a decade ago, Michael’s website serves as a simple and expressive dashboard to hold press kits,
links to social media, and, most importantly, his videos and music.</p>

<p>Throughout Michael’s last few releases, I worked alongside Eddie Mandell to develop a
repertoire of press photos and collateral images. We both conceptualized and shot for
these releases; Eddie handled the final album artwork, and I took care of the press kits.
